# background-generator-exercise

Below you will find the 3 files for the Background Generator. A few things you can try:

1. Write code so that the colour inputs match the background generated on the first page load.
2. Display the initial CSS linear gradient property on page load.
3. BONUS: Add a random button which generates two random numbers for the colour inputs.

I don't understand the first 2 questions.
